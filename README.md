# USA-House-Price-Prediction
House price prediction using ML models and then deploying the model in AWS

In this repository, I have predicted the USA House Price using different models,
and chose the best model i.e., GradintBoostingRegressor in this case.

Then I created the pkl file of the model.

After that I have created the Flask file using Visual Studio Code.

Then by using the AWS EC2 instance, I have deployed my model where I can predict the price of house for unseen data.
